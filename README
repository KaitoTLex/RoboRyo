The RoboRyo is a more redundant clone of National Intstrument's RoboRio. It provides long range controls and less BS compared to the FRC legal RoboRio. The upside of RoboRyo is that there are more configurable ports compared to the real RoboRyo and it also includes quality of Life features that the real RoboRio dosen't have.
